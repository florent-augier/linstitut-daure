          By having this new dynamic yet nested route, we need to create a
          matching nested Route component for it in the App component. First,
          since it is a so called Nested Route (or child route) of the /users
          route, we can nest it in this respective parent Route component. In
          addition, since it is a so called Dynamic Route, it uses a dynamic
          route defined as :userId whereas a user's identifier matches
          dynamically (e.g. user with id of '1' would be matched to /users/1):
